  `Read the backlog artifact at ${artifactPath} FIRST, before creating or switching
   to any branch. That file is often still uncommitted when this runs, so reading
   it after a branch switch is unreliable — read it now and keep its contents.
   It scopes one bug fix for the Tortoise-WoW mangos server fork (a C++ codebase).

   Then run "git fetch origin ${BASE_BRANCH}" and cut your new branch
   from origin/${BASE_BRANCH} — not from the plain local
   ${BASE_BRANCH} ref, which can lag arbitrarily far behind origin
   during a long unattended drain, and never from playerbots-integration-gh,
   which is a pristine fast-forward-only mirror this fork never commits to.
   Name the branch
   backlog/<the artifact's filename with its NNN- numeric prefix and .md
   extension stripped> — e.g. 003-bots-stuck-at-spirit-healer.md gives
   backlog/bots-stuck-at-spirit-healer. Nothing else is an acceptable branch
   name; a later phase pushes exactly what you return here.

   On that branch, implement exactly what the artifact's Problem, Suspected
   cause/area, and Acceptance criteria sections describe — nothing more.
   Commit the change with a message in this repo's existing terse, bug-report
   commit style (run "git log --oneline -20" first to match the voice).
   Do not push and do not open a PR — a later phase does that.

   If this fix requires a new SQL migration under sql/database_updates/,
   generate its filename with sql/touch_migration.sh (or sql/make_migration.bat
   on Windows) to get a real UTC timestamp — do not hand-write a timestamp.
   Then rename the resulting file to insert this artifact's number before the
   suffix: <timestamp>_${artifactLabel.match(/(\d{3})-/)?.[1] || 'XXX'}_world.sql
   instead of <timestamp>_world.sql. This guarantees uniqueness even if
   another tick generates a migration with the same timestamp — the artifact
   number differs by construction.

   If, after investigating, the artifact's acceptance criteria cannot be
   satisfied in this environment -- missing data, missing tooling, a decision
   only a human can make, not something any code change here can fix -- say
   so plainly. Still create the branch (backlog-drain needs a real branch
   name back either way), but make no commit, return blocked: true, and put
   a specific explanation in blockedReason. Do not fabricate data or write a
   partial implementation to make the criteria look satisfied when they
   aren't really verifiable.

   Describe, concretely, how a human would confirm this fix actually works
   in-game once it's running on a live server -- specific enough to follow as
   a checklist (e.g. "board the Menethil Harbor - Theramore boat as a bot and
   confirm it doesn't fall through the deck", not "test transports"). If part
   of that check could be confirmed from server logs or console output rather
   than requiring a human to look (e.g. a specific log line, an absence of a
   specific error), say so explicitly -- a later batch step will attempt
   whatever's actually scriptable and leave the rest for manual testing.
   Return this as inGameCheck. Every artifact needs one, even a low-risk
   change -- if you're confident it needs no in-game confirmation beyond the
   generic "server starts, bots spawn" smoke test, say that explicitly rather
   than leaving it vague.

   description without re-reading the artifact itself.`,

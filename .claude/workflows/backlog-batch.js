   Merge each artifact's branch onto integration/${buildId} in dependency
   order -- an artifact whose base above is another artifact's backlog/<slug>
   branch (not cm-main) must be merged after that dependency, never before.
   For artifacts with no dependency, order smallest-diff-first, matching the
   "blast radius, smallest first" approach in
   docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-12-transport-stack-merge.md -- an early
   conflict or build failure is then cheaper to attribute.

   If a merge produces a real conflict, resolve it toward preserving BOTH
   sides' intent -- read docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-backlog-workflow-design.md's
   "Field report" section first if you haven't: a conflict here is a
   silent-revert trap, not routine text reconciliation, because each branch
   was cut before the others' fixes existed. If you cannot confidently
   resolve a conflict without guessing which side is "correct", do NOT
   guess: abort that one artifact's merge (git merge --abort, or drop just
   its commits if you'd already progressed further), leave the rest of the
   batch merging normally, and list that artifact's path in
   excludedArtifacts so it's retried in a later batch instead of silently
   shipped wrong. Do not push integration/${buildId} anywhere -- it's a
   local scratch branch for the Build phase only, never a PR base.

   killer). Tag the resulting image ${imageTag}.

   attempt docker compose at all -- skip straight to reporting that back.

   project name is pinned to tortoise-wow-v2; tortoise-wow-v2_dbdata is an
   external volume -- never use "docker compose down -v", that volume is the
   entire world). This is a single-developer, no-live-players development
   server -- you are not simulating a player, just confirming the server
   comes up correctly.

   Confirm the baseline liveness smoke test: the server starts, aiplayerbot.conf
   loads, bots spawn. Report that in liveness.

   Then, for each artifact below, attempt only what its inGameCheck says is
   confirmable from logs or console output (not everything is -- most checks
   here will legitimately be "not scriptable, needs a human" and that's
   expected, say so plainly rather than guessing at a result):

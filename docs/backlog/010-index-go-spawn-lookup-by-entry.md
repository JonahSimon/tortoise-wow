# getGameObjectsNear walks every GO spawn in the world on every call

**Problem:** `WorldPosition::getGameObjectsNear` (and its creature twin) runs
`sObjectMgr.DoGOData(worker)`, which iterates the entire `m_GameObjectDataMap`
— every gameobject spawn in the world, not just the current map — and the
`FindPointGameObjectData` predicate always returns `false`, so the loop never
breaks early (`src/game/ObjectMgr.h:1234`).

The map, entry and radius arguments are all applied *inside* the predicate.
They decide which spawns land in the result vector; none of them shortens the
walk. So the cost is the same whether the caller asks for one entry within
200y or for everything on the map.

That walk sits under the elevator/tram fallback in
`WorldPosition::getTransports`, which `MovementAction::UseTransport` calls for
every bot waiting at a transport, every tick. With ~1000 bots this is a
meaningful CPU sink. Other hot callers exist:
`TravelNode.cpp:2417` (`getGameObjectsNear(0, entry)`) and
`RandomPlayerbotMgr.cpp:3017`.

This was originally filed as part of artifact 004 with the proposed fix "pass a
bounded radius instead of `0.0f`". That was withdrawn: a radius cannot fix
this (see above), and bounding the tram lookup actively broke it — callers pass
a *dock* position and select the nearest match themselves, and the six Deeprun
Tram cars sit in two clusters ~2460y apart on map 369, so a 200y filter hid
three of them from either platform.

**Suspected cause / area:**
`src/modules/PlayerBots/playerbot/WorldPosition.cpp:1298-1310`
(`getCreaturesNear` / `getGameObjectsNear`), `:1287`
(`FindPointGameObjectData::operator()`), `src/game/ObjectMgr.h:1234`
(`DoGOData`).

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Looking up GO spawns by entry no longer walks the whole spawn map. Build an
  index (e.g. entry → spawn ids, or map+entry → spawn ids) once and query it,
  so an entry-filtered lookup is proportional to the number of matches.
- Results are unchanged for every existing caller: same spawns, no distance
  filtering introduced where callers relied on its absence. In particular
  `getTransports(entry)` from a dock position must still find a tram car
  ~2500y away on the same map.
- The index is populated from the same data `DoGOData` reads, and stays correct
  across the GM `.gobject add` / `.gobject delete` paths that mutate
  `m_GameObjectDataMap` (`NewGOData` / `DeleteGOData`) — either by updating the
  index there or by documenting and accepting the staleness explicitly.
- Thread safety is considered: map updates can run on multiple threads, so a
  lazily-built shared index needs to be either built once during load or
  guarded.

**Notes:** Per `docs/playerbots/BOT-TRANSPORT-INVESTIGATION.md` ("D2", the
paragraph on why a radius bound is the wrong fix). Split out of artifact 004,
which now fixes only the guid bug and the missing null check.

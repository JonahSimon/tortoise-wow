# Backlog

Scoped issues for the autonomous drain workflow, one file per issue.

## Format

`<NNN>-<slug>.md`, e.g. `003-bots-stuck-at-spirit-healer.md`. `NNN` is a
zero-padded 3-digit sequence number — `backlog-scope` assigns the next one
when it creates a file; `backlog-drain` picks the lowest-numbered `pending`
file each tick.

```markdown
---
status: pending        # pending | in-progress | implemented | done | contested | blocked | failed | out-of-scope
risk: low               # low | medium | high — informational, not a gate
area: playerbots/battlegrounds
depends-on:              # optional: NNN-slug.md this must land after; omit if none

# <Title>

**Problem:** what's actually wrong, in the same voice as the README's fix
tables — what breaks, under what load, traced to what.

**Suspected cause / area:** file(s) or subsystem, if known.

**Acceptance criteria:** concrete, checkable conditions for "this is fixed."

**Notes:** anything else the implementer needs.
```

## Lifecycle

- **pending** — scoped, not yet picked up.
- **in-progress** — `backlog-drain` is currently working it. An artifact left
  at `in-progress` after a tick ends means that tick crashed or was
  interrupted. Drain reports every stuck `in-progress` artifact at the start
  of each tick — they're never silently ignored — but it never re-picks or
  auto-recovers one. Resetting it is a human job: first check whether a PR was
  already opened for it (drain may have crashed *after* pushing, and a blind
  retry would open a second PR for the same fix), then clean up the stale
  worktree and branch as under **failed** below, then set `status: pending`.
- **done** — a PR was opened; see the artifact's `**Result:**` line for the URL.
  "Done" means PR opened, not merged.
- **failed** — drain attempted it and gave up; see `**Failure notes:**`, which
  also records where the failed attempt's worktree and branch were left. Not
  retried automatically. To retry: remove that worktree and branch
  (`git worktree remove <path>` then `git branch -D <branch>`) — git refuses to
  check out a branch that's still checked out in another worktree, so a retry
  with the old one on disk just fails again with a confusing, unrelated-looking
  error — then fix the artifact and reset it to `pending`. A `failed` tick's
  branch was never pushed — `backlog-issue` only implements and reviews now;
  it has no PR phase left to fail at — so there's no remote branch to clean up
  here. (A stuck-mid-push risk now lives in `backlog-batch` instead, which
  pushes and opens PRs for a whole accumulated batch at once — see
  `backlog-drain`'s SKILL.md "Running a batch" section.)
- **out-of-scope** — a human reviewed a `failed` attempt and accepted that the
  work cannot be done here as scoped: it needs a environment, data or decision
  this repo does not have. Not a retry candidate and not a defect to chase; the
  artifact stays as a record of what was ruled out and why. Because drain's
  two-consecutive-failure circuit breaker only counts artifacts whose
  frontmatter still reads `failed`, moving one here also clears it from the
  breaker — which is the intended way to accept a failure and let a future
  drain run continue past it. If the work should happen later under different
  conditions, scope that as a **new** artifact rather than reopening this one.
- **implemented** — `backlog-issue` finished Implement and Review and the
  change is committed to a local branch, but no build, in-stack validation,
  or PR has happened yet. Artifacts wait here until `backlog-drain` has
  accumulated enough of them (or run out of `pending` work) to run one batch
  build instead of one per artifact — see
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-13-backlog-drain-refinements.md` Tasks 7-9.
  Carries the lines `backlog-drain`'s SKILL.md appends when it reaches this
  status: `**Base:**` (the branch it was cut from), `**Branch:**` (the exact
  branch name, authoritative for the later batch pass), `**Summary:**`,
  `**In-game check:**`, `**Minor findings:**` (if any were reported), and
  `**Contested:**` (only if a review finding and the implementer disagreed).
- **contested** — a PR was opened, but a review finding and the implementer
  disagreed and neither could be resolved autonomously. The PR body flags the
  dispute under a "Contested" heading with the finding and the implementer's
  rebuttal. Not the same as `done` — read the disputed finding before trusting
  the diff. Does not count toward the two-consecutive-failure circuit breaker.
- **blocked** — the Implement or Review phase determined the acceptance
  criteria cannot be satisfied in this environment (missing data, missing
  tooling, a decision only a human can make) — distinct from `failed` (a
  fixable defect the implementer got wrong). Not retried automatically and,
  like `out-of-scope`, does not count toward the circuit breaker. Triage:
  either edit the artifact to remove the blocking constraint and reset to
  `pending`, or reclassify to `out-of-scope` if it's permanently infeasible.

## Dependencies

Set `depends-on: <NNN>-<slug>.md` in an artifact's frontmatter when its fix
can only be correctly implemented on top of another artifact's change — e.g.
it edits a function the dependency adds, or its acceptance criteria assume
the dependency's fix already landed. Leave the field blank for artifacts that
don't depend on unmerged work — most artifacts have no dependency.

`backlog-drain` skips a pending artifact whose `depends-on` target has not
yet reached `status: done`, picking the next eligible pending artifact
instead. Once eligible, `backlog-issue` cuts that artifact's branch from the
dependency's branch (not from `cm-main`) whenever the dependency's PR is
still unmerged, falling back to `cm-main` once it has merged. See
"Branch strategy" in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-backlog-workflow-design.md`
for the rationale and the field-report evidence behind it.

A chain (or cycle) of `depends-on` values that never resolves shows up as
every remaining `pending` artifact being ineligible — `backlog-drain` reports
that and stops rather than looping forever.

## Producing artifacts

Use the `backlog-scope` skill (`/backlog-scope`) — it interviews you for the
sections above and writes the file with the right number and slug.

## Draining artifacts

Use the `backlog-drain` skill via `/loop backlog-drain` — it works through
`pending` artifacts one at a time, fully autonomously, implementing and
reviewing each to `status: implemented` on its own local branch. Once several
`implemented` artifacts have accumulated (or the backlog runs out of
`pending` work), it runs one `backlog-batch` pass to build, validate in the
running stack, and open a PR per artifact in that batch — see
`backlog-drain`'s SKILL.md "Running a batch" section. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-backlog-workflow-design.md` for the full
design.

### Prerequisites

Before a drain run:

- **An authenticated `gh` CLI** (`gh auth status`) for the account that owns
  the fork, with push rights to `origin`. Every `backlog-batch` pass pushes
  a branch and runs `gh pr create` per artifact in that batch — no prompting,
  no fallback.
- **A supervised pilot run.** This automation is new and has never completed
  a real unattended run, so before trusting it with the backlog: put one
  throwaway artifact scoping a trivial change into this directory, run one
  implement tick and then one batch pass by hand with a human watching, and
  confirm both actually worked end to end, ending with a real PR URL. Then
  close the throwaway PR and delete its branch, worktree, and artifact.
  `backlog-drain`'s "Before trusting an unattended run" section spells out
  exactly what to check at each step.
- **A human watching the first few real ticks and the first real batch.**
  Start the loop, don't walk away from it. Only a `backlog-batch` pass opens
  PRs, against `cm-main` (or a stacked `backlog/<slug>` base) — one per
  artifact accumulated in that batch — and there is no CI and no test suite
  to catch a bad one.

### Stopping a drain

Create `docs/backlog/.stop` (an empty file — `touch docs/backlog/.stop`) to
halt the loop. `backlog-drain` checks for it at the very start of each tick,
before picking a new artifact, so a stop request never aborts an issue
mid-implementation: whatever is already in flight finishes (an implement tick
just commits locally now, it no longer opens a PR), and the loop halts before
starting another — but first, if any artifact is sitting at
`status: implemented`, it runs one `backlog-batch` pass so nothing is left
stranded waiting on a batch that would otherwise never trigger. The sentinel
works whether or not anyone is watching the conversation. Drain reports a
done/failed/in-progress/implemented/pending summary, deletes the sentinel,
and stops.

The loop also halts on its own when the backlog is drained, when two
artifacts fail in a row, when every remaining `pending` artifact is blocked
on an unready dependency, when a failure looks systemic (a broken workflow
invocation rather than a bad artifact — the artifact is put back to `pending`
rather than marked `failed`), or when a `backlog-batch` pass itself fails
(a build break, or nothing left to build after integration exclusions — every
artifact in that batch stays at `status: implemented` for a human to retry or
investigate, rather than being marked `failed`). See `backlog-drain`'s
SKILL.md "Stopping the loop" section for the full detail.
